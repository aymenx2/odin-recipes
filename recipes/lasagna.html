    <h2><p>Lasagna is a rich, hearty Italian dish composed of layers of wide, flat pasta, each sheet supporting a balanced mixture of flavors. It typically includes savory, seasoned ground meat or vegetables, a creamy ricotta or béchamel layer, and marinara or meat sauce. These ingredients, interlaced with gooey mozzarella and parmesan, meld together in the oven, creating a golden, bubbling top layer. When baked, lasagna's layers infuse, capturing a balance of creamy, tangy, and umami-rich flavors in every bite. This comfort food embodies warmth and a satisfying depth that makes it a beloved classic.</p></h2>
