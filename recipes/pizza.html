<h2><p>Pizza is a beloved Italian dish featuring a round, thin, or thick crust topped with a savory tomato sauce, melted cheese, and a variety of toppings. Classic pizzas often include fresh mozzarella, basil, and olive oil for a Margherita style, or pepperoni for a spicier, meatier flavor. The crust, crispy on the outside and soft within, holds each layer of toppings together. Baked to perfection, pizza is known for its mouthwatering blend of gooey cheese, rich sauce, and satisfying crunch, making it a universal favorite for any meal or occasion.</p></h2>
